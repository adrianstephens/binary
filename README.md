This package provides a set of utilities for reading and writing binary data in TypeScript. It includes various interfaces, types, and functions to facilitate binary data manipulation.

## Installation

To install the package, use npm:

```
npm install my-binary-package
```

## Usage

Here is a basic example of how to use the package:

```typescript
import { stream, ReadStruct, WriteStruct } from 'my-binary-package';

// Create a new stream from a Uint8Array
const data = new Uint8Array([/* binary data */]);
const binaryStream = new stream(data);

// Define a structure to read from the stream
const MyStruct = ReadStruct({
    // Define your structure here
});

// Read data from the stream
const myData = new MyStruct(binaryStream);

// Write data back to the stream
const writeStream = new stream(new Uint8Array(1024));
const myWriteStruct = WriteStruct({
    // Define your structure here
});
myWriteStruct.put(writeStream, myData);
```
